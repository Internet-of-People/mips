# Title of the Proposal

<!--
You can leave these HTML comments in your merged MIP and delete the visible duplicate text guides, they will not appear and may be helpful to refer to if you edit it again. Editors will remove them from the final versions 

This is the suggested template for new MIPs.

Note that an MIP number will be assigned later by editors. When opening a pull request to submit your MIP, copy this `mip-x.md` as `new-title_of_proposal.md` in the same folder. The title should be shorter than 44 characters, but should express the goal of the proposal. This way the slug in the filename improves SEO.

When the MIP reaches **Accepted** status the PR will be merged by the editors after assigning a number. As part of that editors will rename `new-title_of_proposal.md` to `mip-<number>-new-title_of_proposal.md` and will change the `mip:` field in the markdown header. If you added anything to the `assets/new` folder, it will be renamed to `assets/mip-<number>` and all references will be updated correspondingly.

## Simple Summary

<!--
"If you can't explain it simply, you don't understand it well enough." Provide a simplified and layman-accessible explanation of the MIP.

## Abstract

<!--
A short (~200 word) description of the technical issue being addressed.

A short (~200 word) description of the technical issue being addressed.

## Motivation

<!--
The motivation is critical for MIPs that want to change the Mercury standards. It should clearly explain why the existing protocol specification is inadequate to address the problem that the MIP solves. MIP submissions without sufficient motivation may be rejected outright.

## Specification

<!--
The technical specification should describe the syntax and semantics of any new feature. The specification should be detailed enough to allow competing, interoperable implementations for any of the current Mercury platforms.

## Rationale

<!--
The rationale fleshes out the specification by describing what motivated the design and why particular design decisions were made. It should describe alternate designs that were considered and related work, e.g. how the feature is supported in other languages. The rationale may also provide evidence of consensus within the community, and should discuss important objections or concerns raised during discussion.

## Backwards Compatibility

<!--
All MIPs that introduce backwards incompatibilities must include a section describing these incompatibilities and their severity. The MIP must explain how the author proposes to deal with these incompatibilities. MIP submissions without a sufficient backwards compatibility treatise may be rejected outright.

## Test Cases

<!--
Test cases for an implementation are mandatory for MIPs that are affecting protocol changes and might cause hard forks. Other MIPs can choose to include links to test cases if applicable.

## Implementation

<!--
The implementations must be completed before any MIP is given status **Final**, but it need not be completed before the MIP is **Accepted**. While there is merit to the approach of reaching consensus on the specification and rationale before writing code, the principle of "rough consensus and running code" is still useful when it comes to resolving many discussions of API details.
